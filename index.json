[{"categories":["California Life"],"contents":"Telecom carrier choosing As a student, finding the best deal is my top priority when choosing a telecom carrier. Price plays a crucial role in determining which carrier suits my budget and needs. Additionally, some telecom carriers offer eSim, which is particularly helpful for international students like me. One of the main reasons eSim is valuable to me is because I can use my hometown sim card to receive important SMS, such as credit card authorization messages. This flexibility allows me to stay connected to essential services while enjoying the benefits and cost savings of my chosen carrier\u0026rsquo;s plan.\nAs I embark on this decision-making journey, I understand the significance of striking the right balance between affordability and essential features. By considering both the price and eSim availability, I aim to find a telecom carrier that not only offers a great deal but also caters to my unique needs as an international student.\n","permalink":"https://Shu682682.github.io/blog/telecom/","tags":["Communication","USA"],"title":"Telecom carrier"},{"categories":["Tasty Journey"],"contents":"Brunch Imagine a lazy Sunday morning, and I\u0026rsquo;m all set to chow down on a mouthwatering brunch that\u0026rsquo;s a total flavor explosion.

As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve had to rely on virtual methods to explore available options. However, this approach comes with its own set of concerns, particularly the need to be cautious about potential housing scammers.\nPrice, proximity to my school, and safety are critical factors I must consider while evaluating housing options. Connecting with landlords to gather information has taken up a significant amount of my time, as I strive to make informed decisions from afar.\nAnother hurdle arises when it comes to remitting the deposit to the landlord before my arrival. Since I lack friends or relatives in California who can help authenticate the process, I find myself facing the risk of potential scams. Losing the deposit in case the landlord disappears without providing the promised accommodation is a distressing thought.\nFurthermore, not having a car limits my options as I must ensure the chosen house is within a reasonable distance from my school. After extensive searching and deliberation, I have finally found a house that requires a mere 15-minute bike ride to reach my campus. While it may not be the most convenient, it is the most affordable option available.\n","permalink":"https://Shu682682.github.io/blog/house_rental/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"Test\nPancake Test Test Hello What are you quote\nword(/blog/post-1)\nThis is testhello\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;) Tables Are Cool col 3 is right-aligned $1600 col 2 is centered $12 zebra stripes are neat $1 ","permalink":"https://Shu682682.github.io/blog/pancake/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"Pancake ","permalink":"https://Shu682682.github.io/blog/test2/","tags":null,"title":""}]
